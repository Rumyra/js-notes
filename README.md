# JS Notes

Notes from all the JavaScript material I'm learning from.

I thought about a notebook and then I realised I had already started practical note taking with JS Patterns, so I may as well pop them all here.

I doubt they'll be helpful to learners, but for anyone who has used any of the materials might be good for refreshing.

All notes can be viewed in the browser, but comments are in the code so it's advisable to read through index files.

### So far

- [O'Reilly JavaScript Patterns by Stoyan Stefanov](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596806767.do) (I haven't finished this book yet)
