  <h2>Intro to react.js</h2>

  <p>It's not a framework - it does the UI very well - it's the V in MVC.</p>

  <h3>Component Driven</h3>

  <p>It's component driven, so it's all about creating HTML components that take state and properties and produce components. State can be changed, properties can not.</p>

  <p>Components are optionally written in JSX, which means you can use HTML, rather than <code>createElement</code> The DOM representation in react is referred to as the virtual DOM, which is faster than the browsers DOM.</p>

  <p>React computes the difference between whats in the DOM and what's been updated and just changes the updates - not the whole element</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Include react.js and react-dom.js (CDN, node package or bower)</li>
    <li>Use external js file, rename extension to .jsx so react can parse as such</li>
    <li>Create DOM element for react to hook into</li>
    <li>To create component in react - use createClass method. Takes an object with properties - only required property is <code>render</code></li>
    <li>Use React.render and pass in component name and root dom element.</li>
    <li></li>
